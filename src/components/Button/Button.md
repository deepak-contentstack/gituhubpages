# Button

## Best practices

- Use clear and accurate labels.
- Start button labels with verbs, for example "Add field", not "New field".
- Keep the position of the buttons consistent on the interface.
- Reduce the complexity by using a small number of actions on the interface. It may create confusion if too many actions are used.
